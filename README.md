# Capstone

##Capstone Repository for VRB01

All files are executable using Google Collab. There is no need to externally download dependencies as the notebook will dynamically take care of all the requirements.
In case the code base needs to be tested extenally specfile.txt can be used to download dependencies for any environment.
 In such cases, if certain dependencies need to be redownloaded add a code block at the end of the required file and use command `!pip list -v`
 
 For testing the tranformer on a public dataset, use the [librispeech file](Tranformer_librispeech.ipynb)
